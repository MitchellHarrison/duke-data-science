# Lecture 9 - Code as Bits pt.2
`%rip` is the **instruction pointer**. It cannot be written to by a programmer
and contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.

**NOTE FOR EXAM: Can print out x64 cheat sheet and bring it to the exam** 

We use `malloc` to allocate memory on the heap. Stack memory goes away after a
function returns, and globals are fast, but you can't dynamically change the
number of globals during runtime. Thus, even though heap memory is more expensive,
we use it when we need a longer-term value in memory that we can assign 
dynamically during runtime.

When a number is being used as an argument alone in ASM, it is preceded by `$`.
When used as an offset (i.e. `48(%rbi)`, no `$` is required.

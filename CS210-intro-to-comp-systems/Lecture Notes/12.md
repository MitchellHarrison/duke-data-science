# Lecture 12 - Procedures
The three most significant registers that are involved in procedure calls are
the stack pointer, the program counter, and **TODO**

The three opcodes that can access `%rip` (the instruction pointer) are jumps, 
`call`, or `ret`

`callq` into a procedure `p()` pushed the `%rip` value as the *return address*.
The `retq` at the end of a procedure pops the return address back into `%rip`.

The `pushq` instruction pushes the **frame pointer (base pointer)** to save it,
and the `popq` restores the old frame pointer (`%rbp`).

**Re-entrance** is when procedures can be called again before the first call
returns. This makes *recurrsion* possible.

**NOTE:** Each register holds 8 bytes at most. Saving any values bigger than that
has to be done in memory.

---

A **register spill** is when a value cannot be saved to a register because they 
are full, and is saved to memory (which is far slower) instead.

There are conventions that prevent register spills, since a callee cannot tell 
whether or not a caller relies on any given register.

**Caller-saved registers** are registers that the **caller** is responsible for
fixing if it "clobbers" (aka overwrites) the value of.

The **callee-saved registers** are the same as caller-saved ones, but for the 
callee.

By convention, certain registers are callee- and caller-saved, but we don't need
to memorize which is which for this course.

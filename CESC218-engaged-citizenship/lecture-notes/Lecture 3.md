## Lecture Notes
**Requirement for class**: Think intelligently about the relationship between lecture 2's "civic vs political engagement" and today's [Pathways to Public Service](https://haas.stanford.edu/about/our-approach/pathways-public-service-and-civic-engagement).

__*Review 6 Pathways to Public Service*__:
3) Is this more of a Band Aid? Can it cause social change?
4) can often be abused to give the rich disproportionate power. **This shouldn't need to exist (at least domestically) if policymakers are doing a good job. Philanthropists are often the reason that policymakers aren't doing a good job**
5) looks like last lecture's *political engagement*
6) *social innovation* is a phrase that often ends up meaningless. Many business claim it unjustly.

A: *Check lecture slides for answer in long quote*

Q: What are *not* social movements?

## Video notes:
- Book recommendation: *Twitter and Tear Gas*
- Civil right movement was successful because of long-term logistics and support
- Occupy Wall St failed because movement wasn't taken as a threat by legislators
- *Slacktivism* is a problem because people don't mobilize after signing some online petition somewhere, but makes a good first step.
- Algorithmic amplification of ideas on social media can change the outcome of a movement. **Better or worse?**
	- Ex: ice bucket challenge killed an attempted movement on Facebook
- Social media may be better for global/national movements, but weak on local level. (scale up too fast)


*Note: slides will be posted after lecture*

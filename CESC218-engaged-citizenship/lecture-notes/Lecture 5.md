## Notes
Freedom House's [Antidemocratic Turn](https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2021/antidemocratic-turn):
- democracy is trending down globally
- US democracy trending down (-11 points 2010-2020)

Economic inequality and the economic order drives the decline in democracy

Cultrual diversity poses a potential problem when people too rigidly stick to their own in-group

*How much is education required to participate in democracy?*

**Poverty drives division**: a rich family having one cookie left doesn't mean fighting among the kids, but in a poor family where cookies are rare, it may.

*Dahl pg.197*: leaders must be ready to give up power if they lose an election:
- this is easier in strong economies where former politicians can go off and increase their wealth with book deals, consulting, etc.

### Not Another Politics Podcast: Do Americans Support Democracy as much as They Say? (right after Jan 6):
- To what extent are voters willing to give up their democracy to get their policy?
- breaking liberal democracy usually is a long process done by a democratically-elected leader 
- Pro- or anti-democratic candidates vary on more then their policy on democracy
- The experiment:
	- hypothetical candidates were given gender, age, race, policy etc.
	- candidates at random were said to have supported anti-democratic actions (election fraud, etc.)
	- Results:
		- If you are a *partisan extremeist* (very much one side or the other), you are more likely to support a candidate an anti-democratic candidate on your political side
		- political centrists/independents are more likely to punish anti-democratic candidates
		- not all candidates are realistic since they are hypothetical (democrats that want to ban taxes, etc.)
		- when looking at realistic candidates, <5% of voters punish anti-democratic candidates on their side
	- Montana election:
		- 2017 special election
		- Absentee voters the day before the election day voted one way
		- Day before election, a candidate physically attacked a journalist
		- election-day voters voted post-attack, which is an anti-democratic act
		- <5% of election-day voters (in primarily moderate counties) punished the violent candidate, roughly in line with experiment
	- Papers findings:
		- americans value democracy, but not much
		- centrists support democracy most
		- democratic support varies
		- polarization hurts democracy
		- americans have solid understanding of democracy
		- supporters of both parties employ a partisain "double standard"

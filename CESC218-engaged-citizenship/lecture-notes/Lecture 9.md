# Lecture 9 - 27SEP22
## Trump is good (cont'd)
### Eliminating fake news
Free press is essential for the functioning of democracy

Calling out fake news helps keep the media honest, which is ultimately good for democracy

### Federalism
The balance of federal/state government should be more towards states and localities

Trump "maintains proper balance"
- i.e.: deregulating education and giving power to the states to regulate education

### Finally, there is a choice
With Trump, gone are the days of candidates drifting to the middle and finding common ground. This means that if you are conservative all the way, you finally have a candidate that speaks to your views. Like Bernie with liberals.

### People trying to stop him from running
He is qualified to run legally

Justice system and FBI has been politically deployed against him unjustly

### Did Trump damage democracy?
Even with Trump, the system has held. Academic/political elites are upset that people traditionally without voice finally have a voice.

Trump undermined norms, but not institutions.

He did not weaken congress, was impeached twice, courts consistently ruled against him (muslim ban, 61/62 cases around electoral fraud)

States were able to excersise their rights during COVID becaue Trump got out of the way.

Has not weaked the press

Has not weakened the courts, as demonstrated by their recent impact on day-to-day life.

### IMPORTANT NOTE:
Class will require that we can defend Trump as well as the professor can. *REVIEW THIS MATERIAL FOR THE MIDTERM*

Also review how political scientists conduct studies/statistical analysis

## Interest Groups
### Arthur Bently
Q: What is *pluralism*?
A: The working of interest groups, not individuals, that constitutes politics.

There is no such thing as public interest.

Cannot get rid of interest groups, only rearrange the balance of power between groups

Pluralism says that the *government is an umpire between groups*, creating the rules inside which these interset groups act

Pluralism is similar to:
- Realism in international relations
- markets in economics

### Neo-pluralism
Q: What is *neo-pluralism?*
A: Sees multiple groups competing over political influence, but government will default to the interests of the government (like a Yankee's fan being an umpire)

Views the state as a relatively autonomous actor with various departments that look after their own difference. (DoD captured by military contractors, etc).

Even with departments, neo-pluralists see the state as one big thing with its own interests

Neo-pluralism says that the most powerful influences are economic influences.

## Interest Groups
Q: What is an *interest group*?
A: An organization of people who share common interest and work together to promote/protect those interests by influencing government

Divided into **economic** (Alcoholic Beverage Association of America) and **non-economic** (pro-life) groups.

This is a model that differs from individualism

For every interest, there is a competing interest and most have interest groups

### Topology of interest groups
Public interest groups - Greenpeace common cause
Professional groups - American Medical Assn, American Bar Assn
One-issue groups - NRA, Natnl Org for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NROML)
Ideological Groups - Christian Coalition (others are often religious, but not always)

### Tactics and PACs
- Pools campaign contributions and donates them
- Corporations and labor can donate via PACs
- $5,000 to a candidate for each election, $15,000 for a political party
- Unlimited if independent

## Notes for class
Review Gilens and Page for Thursday's lecture for group work with classmates

Professor is strongly personally interested in interest groups. 

After Unify America Challenge, do we think that talking across the aisle is the solution to the divide in America? Does talking about certain things give legitimacy to patently false views? What are the priciples on which we base our decisions about what deserves legitimacy?

## Lecture Notes
### Trump is good:
- dislodge anti-democratic deep state
- withdraw from undemocratic international treaties
- eliminate voter fraud
- protects free press by calling out fake news and arguing for truth
- federalism - move power to states instead of feds
- electoral college is democratic 
- give people a choice

### Dislodge deep state
Q: What is the *deep state*?
A: unelected government administrators that impact how we live, sometimes in opposition to elected officials

NYT piece about insiders working against Trump's most violent tendencies (Miles Taylor). This is undemocratic. He won the election, he should be given a chance to govern. This means that the deep state exists and is actively working against Trump.

Mark Milley gave his word to China's People Liberation Army that he wouldn't let Trump do anything crazy before he left office. This violated civilian control of the military in the face of Trump, an elected president.

### Withdraw from international treaties
Post-WWII there was a web of international organizations/treaties that constrain the members of those groups/treaties.

These treaties damage American sovereignty

Brexit was a similar move in Britain

Trump left UNESCO, TPP, Paris Agreement, Iran Nuclear Deal, and UN Rights Commission

Trump: "My administration will never surrender American sovereignty." and "We live by American laws, not the laws of foreign countries."

Trump fights against *globalists*

*Book recommendations*:
- Killing the Deep State: the Fight to Defend President Trump
- How Trump Haters are Breaking America: Resistance at All Costs
- The Dying Citizen

### Electoral College
Trump would have run differently but didn't because of the system in place.

Intentionally rejects majoritarian rule

### Eliminate voter fraud
Sanctity of elections is crucial to liberal democracy

Eliminating voter fraud definitionally defends democracy

Democrats took advantage of the pandemic to increase participation without proper oversight

Changes to voting systems during the pandemic were well-intentioned but unnecessary

[The Center for Tech and Civic Life](https://www.techandciviclife.org/) introduced liberal money to control of the elections, and got big payments from tech giants like Mark Zuckerberg, that donate to Democrats over 90% of the time.

### Dead set on implementing voter preferences
Why impeach Trump so close to an election, when the people are about to have their voices heard by an election?

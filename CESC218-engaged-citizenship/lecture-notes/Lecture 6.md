Duke lacks viewpoint diversity, although has basically every other kind.

"Power (aka majorities) should be constrained in a way that protects individual rights and liberties"

Majorities should resolve policy disputes except when they involve fundamental human rights

## Notes on Zakaria:
- the decline of democratic *norms and behaviors*. 
- *civic associations* are on the decline (people doing things together, social clubs, etc), which makes people more individualistic
- book recommendation (*Bowling Alone*)

## Brennan
*Epistemic/Instrumental* - leads to good outcomes compared to alternatives (good because the end result is good, however you define it)

*Aretaic* - it makes positive impact on the participants

*Intrinsic* - good in and of itself

Brennan says we need less participation

Democracy is only good if it produces good and stable outcomes

When citizens demonstrate competence, they justify their vote. The emotional, uneducated, irrational, etc demonstrate their disqualification to vote.

### Brennan's types
*hobbit* - apolitical, most non-voters, lives without politics
*hooligans* - rabid sports fans, many party members/activists, biased, overconfident
*vulcans* - scientific/rational, open to others, seek to understand

### Forms of epistocracy
*restricted suffrage* - judge competance before allowing vote (how?)
*plural voting* - better educated = more votes
*enfranchisement lottery* - chosen and then trained to vote
*epistocratic vote* - selected body can veto democratic rules
*weighted voting* - weighted based on political knowledge

### Brennan - why don't people participate?
- Cannot
- Don't want to
- Nobody asked/recruited
